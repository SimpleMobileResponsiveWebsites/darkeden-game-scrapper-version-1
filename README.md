Congratulations on creating a web scraper! This code appears to be written in Python using a library like requests and BeautifulSoup.

To create a README file for this codebase, I'll provide a brief overview of what this code does and how it works.

What does this code do?

This code is a web scraper designed to scrape data from the website www.dkgenesis.com. The scraper extracts HTML content, CSS, JavaScript, and image data from the website.

How does it work?

The code uses the requests library to send an HTTP request to the website and retrieve its HTML content. It then uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and extract specific elements, such as links, images, and text.

The scraper has several functions:

Enter Website URL: The user is prompted to enter a URL to scrape.
Scraping: The scraper extracts data from the website, including HTML content, CSS, JavaScript, and image data.
Output: The scraped data is stored in a file or displayed in a GUI.
Notes for future maintenance and development

Error handling: Add error handling to handle cases where the website is down or returns an error.
Flexibility: Consider adding options for users to customize what data they want to scrape and how they want to store it.
Performance: Optimize the code for performance by reducing unnecessary requests and improving parsing efficiency.
Documentation: Document the code thoroughly, including explanations of each function and how they work together.
How to use this code

To use this code, simply run it in your Python interpreter or save it as a Python file and execute it using Python.
